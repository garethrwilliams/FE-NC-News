# NC-News - Portfolio React Web App

deployed at: https://gareths-nc-news.netlify.app/

## Project Overview

- NC News is a reddit style react web app where users can post, read, and comment upon articles.
- Articles can be filtered by category, and sorted with a variety of metrics.
- All articles and comments can be voted upon
- In this example app, you are automatically signed in as cooljmessy and can only alter content added by that user

## Backend

- Articles, users and comments are retrieved via an api hosted at https://gareths-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api .
- The backend for this project was also written by me and can be found at https://github.com/garethrwilliams/NC-News
